# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple 3x3 Tic Tac Toe

A classic game of Tic Tac Toe made completely in C.

Rules:
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where each plot is marked from 0 (first square) to 8 (last square).
- Players can choose X or O as their character (Note: X always starts first, followed by O)
- The player who achieves a connecting pattern of a straight line (horizontal, verticle, or diagonally) wins the game.
- The game ends in a draw if all the 9 squares are full and none of the players achieve a winning pattern.

Available gamemodes: Player 1 vs Player 2 [X and O], Player vs Computer [Coming soon]
This project is currently a work in progress.
